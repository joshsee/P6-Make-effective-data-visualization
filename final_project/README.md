# Summary
The goal of this visualization is to compare the performance of 1157 baseball player in terms of their batting average and home runs. User is allowed to view the top 10 to top 30 players based on their batting average and home runs or user can just simple filter by their performance.

# Design
* Keeping a pie chart there is to let the user know the total handedness od baseball players selected.
* It's kind of cluttered when displaying all the players. So adding in a filter feature there should allow the user to see the top performance player.
* Having a bubble chart of Homerun versus Batting average allows the user to see each player's performance directly.
